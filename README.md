# 🏥 Insurance Claim Prediction App  

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Insurance Claim Prediction App** is a machine learning–powered tool designed to **predict health insurance claim amounts** based on customer health and lifestyle information.  
By incorporating multiple factors such as **age, BMI, smoking status, region, and pre-existing conditions**, the app enables insurers to **assess risk more accurately** and **make data-driven decisions** about premiums and claim forecasting.  



## 🚀 Business Problem  
The insurance industry struggles with:  
- Accurately assessing risk to set **fair premiums**.  
- Minimizing **financial discrepancies** caused by inaccurate predictions.  
- Incorporating the **complexity of modern health profiles** into risk modeling.  

Our solution enhances the **accuracy of claim predictions**, helping insurers:  
- Reduce **financial risk**.  
- Improve **premium setting**.  
- Automate the prediction pipeline for **real-time decision-making**.
